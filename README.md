# PrintUtil
java print util,used jacob and pdfbox  java调用打印机打印的工具类，用到了jacob和pdfbox
With this util, you can print png,jpg,pdf,word,excel,ppt simplify with a printer.
I will replace Chinese annotations to English annotations recently, If this util is well-received.
My English is not good, I try to finish the readme by translation. 

## demo
First, ` PrintUtil.getDeviceList() `get your device name(Or you know its name)
Next,
` PrintUtil.print(filePath, deviceName) `, program will print you file in few time.

If you use ` PrintUtil.print(filePath) `, program will print you file with default printer.
